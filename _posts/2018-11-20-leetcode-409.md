## Description

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

**Note:**  
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

**Example:**

    Input:
    "abccccdd"

    Output:
    7

    Explanation:
    One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

## Solution

Use `dictionary` can solve this problem easily. But when I see other's solution, I saw a very clever method. The author use `>>`, `<<` and `&`, `|` to determine whether add the `value` or `value-1`.

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0
        count = Counter(s)
        for i in count.values():
            res += (i>>1) <<1
            res |= i&1
        return res
```

For every letter in the string, if the number of this letter is even we can just add this number. On the other hand if the number is odd we should add `number - 1`. The author use `(i>>1) <<1` to solve this. In this way every binary number's last digit can be set to `0`. 

We should also consider that in the middle of palindromes the number of letters can be odd. Just like `acbbbca`. So we should add `1` to the result when there existing a letter's number is odd, but only add once. I think it is much more clever here. The author use `res |= i&1` to achieve this. If the number is odd the last digit of binary res will be set to `1`, same result as adding one. And this digit will not be changed again, means this process only work once.
