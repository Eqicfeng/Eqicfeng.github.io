## Description

Given an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

Return its postorder traversal as: [5,6,3,2,4,1].

**Note:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Solution

Recursive solution is very easy, I don't talk about it here. But how to do it iteratively? It's much harder than preorder traversal. I spend nearly one hour to write a solution like this(so stupid I am):

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val, children):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
"""
class Solution(object):
    def postorder(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Node
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not root:
            return []
        stack=[root]
        r=[]
        while stack:
            root=stack[-1]
            while root.children:
                stack.extend(root.children[::-1])
                root.children=None
                root=stack[-1]
            root=stack.pop()
            r.append(root.val)
        return r
```

But when I look at other's solution, I find one way to solve this problem very easily. Think about the relationship between preorder traversal and postorder traversal. If we can change a preorder traversal, traverse the child node from right to left. The result of the preorder traversal will be the reversal of the postorder traversal. And the preorder traversal is very easy. So we can do this problem iteratively in a much easier way:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def postorder(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Node
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not root:
            return []
        r=[]
        stack=[root]
        while stack:
            node=stack.pop()
            r.append(node.val)
            stack.extend(node.children[::1])
        return r[::-1]
```
